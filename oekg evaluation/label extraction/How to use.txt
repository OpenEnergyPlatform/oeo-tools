labels.py is called like this:

python3 labels.py [path to omn file] [alt | labels | ger | all]

output: textfile labels.txt
alt: extracts all alternative labels of the file
labels: extracts (non alternative) labels of the file
ger: extracts German alternative labels of the file
all: all of the above

if you want to combine these with the labels from the glossary while sorting out doubles you can use mergeLists.py:

python3 mergeLists [path to first list.txt] [path to second list.txt]
output: textfile mergedList.txt
