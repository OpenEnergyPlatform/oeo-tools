There are two scripts. This one is querying a file:

python3 wordFinder.py [path to your rdf data file] [path to the file holding labels].

The output will be printed into a file called abstract_evaluation.txt.
You may need to instal rdflib first.

///

This one is querying the OEKG endpoint:

python3 endpointWordFinder.py [path to the file holding labels]

The output will be printed into a file called abstract_evaluation2.txt.

///

The file with all current OEO labels taken from the glossary and current alternative labels extracted from the omn files is provided in this folder and is called allLabels.txt.
